"From the information given we can see the light of speed is inversely proportional the refractive index of the medium. We can estimate the speed of light in glass as speed of light in vacuum divided by the medium's refractive index. In case of glass that would be 300Km/1.5 = 200Km/sec.

The estimated speed of light in glass will be around 200 Km/sec"

"Qualities that make a good manager could vary. Different managers bring different things to the table in different situations to help the team and company. Here are a few qualities that are generally useful:
1. Hiring: Primary job for a manager is to build a good team which is not possible without hiring the team.
2. Building trust: It's important for a manager to build trust with each individual on their team but also within the team members themselves to create a culture for collaboration

4. Prioritization: Teams often have more work than they have people and managers play a critical role in prioritizing tasks to ensure the higher impact tasks are done first.
5. Flexibility: Managers must be willing to play different roles as the situation demands it ranging from hands on domain expertise to conflict resolution to culture builder."

"There are many ways to argue who the best pitchers of all time are.  Some of the criteria to consider are Cy Young Awards, ERA titles, strike out titles and records, post season success, and longevity.  With these criteria heavily considered some of the best MLB pitchers of all time could be as follows.

5. Roger Clemens (The Rocket) pitched for 24 seasons and compiled accolades such as a record holding 7 Cy Young Awards, an MVP title, 5 strike out titles, 7 ERA titles, and won 2 World Series titles. 

4. Pedro Martinez had the 4th highest win percentage in history, won the world series, won 3 Cy Young Awards, an MVP Award, and is one of only 4 pitchers to ever have more than 3,000 strike outs while walking fewer than 1,000.  

3. Randy Johnson (The Big Unit) played for 22 MLB seasons and is the all time record holder for Wins, ranks 2nd all time for strike outs, won 5 Cy Young Awards, won The World Series. 

2. Cy Young is one of the most legendary pitchers of all time and the annual award for the best pitcher in each MLB league is named after him. Some of his many accomplishments are that he is the all time leader for wins, innings pitched, and complete games. 

1. Walter Johnson (The Big Train) was one of the ""First Five"" inaugurated into the MLB hall of fame.  He is the all time leader in shut outs and was the all time leader for strikeouts for more than 55 years.  He won The World Series and also is the all time leader for leading the league in strike outs 12 times."

"She can perform weight shifts, which is an easy exercise for someone of her age to perform to improve their balance. She should begin with feet hip-width apart, and then shift her weight to her right side, lifting her left foot off the floor. She can maintain this position for 30 seconds, return to the starting position, and repeat for her other side. Besides weight shifts, she can focus on exercises that target auxiliary muscles in her lower back and core, which help with balance. For example, she can consider doing partial sit-ups, which strengthen abdominal muscles, or if she finds that too difficult, she can perform cat and camel, which is where she arches her back, and then lets it slowly sag toward the floor while in modified pushup position (knees on the ground)."

"Absolutely no! Daylight Savings originated around WWI in an effort to conserve fuel and electricity. US enacted the act to preserve Daylight saving time in 1918 and established standard time zone across the States. However, with modern power grids and diverse night life, Daylight Savings is seemingly not relevant today. A lot of people complain about the inconvenience in turning the clock back and forth twice a year. The rate of being late for schedules or air flights on the day of daylight saving starts or ends every year is much higher than any other day in a year. In fact, even in the US, Arizona and Hawaii do not recognize daylight saving time. So do a lot of other countries like China and Japan. For European countries, the daylight saving switch date differs from one to another. All the chaos of daylight saving cause more trouble in schedule across-region appointments and meetings than any benefits of it if we can think of any."

"Cancun is divided into two areas. Downtown, also known as Ciudad Cancun — and Cancun Island, also known as The Hotel Zone or “Zona Hotelera”. The Hotel Zone is the primary tourist area, synonymous with resorts, catamarans, wild nightlife and beaches. It’s a 15-mile strip of sand shaped like the number seven. This is where most people stay.

Then cover the slice of bread with melted cheese with the other slice of bread and remove from the frying pan.

Gently crack an egg and place it into the frying pan. Cook until the egg whites are hardened. You may then cook until the yolks are of your desired consistency.

"One good method is to practice your lines of the play with other people, who might not necessarily be in the play (for example, practice with your parents!). It's also good to review your lines and repeat them by heart a few minutes later. Then over time try to repeat them without looking at the play book. One thing to avoid is to only read the lines but not say them out loud. Saying the lines out loud is really important for remembering them and practicing your acting. And above all, try to have fun!"

"One idea humanity to implement to rapidly cool the planet to help minimize the effects of global warming would be to block some or all of the sunlight (UV radiation) hitting the planet from the sun. Sometimes referred to as GeoEngineering, these are projects on a truly planet-size scale. A project like this could, for example, consist of large reflective lightweight solar sails or other loft-able reflective material which could be seeded into the upper atmosphere to reflect some or all of the sunlight back into space. Another Idea would be to create massive and plentiful Co2 scrubbers to remove a noticeable quantity of the greenhouse gas, Co2, which works to reflect and prevent heat from the planet from leaving back out into space. Greatly reducing the quantity of Co2 in our atmosphere would allow more heat to escape the planet and consequently cool it down. Yet another thought might be to artificially and greatly increase the size of our ice caps which would lead to more sunlight being reflected back out into space. Yet another approach could be to mimic nature in prior heavily volcanic periods and inject massive quantities of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere in the hopes of producing conditions that in the past led to mini ice-ages."
